Todayâ€™s generation is more concerned with physical fitness, which means overall well-being and the ability to perform a variety of exercises, be it high-level sports or typical daily tasks in IT. Mental health is also important, as it contributes significantly to overall well-being. Due to the demands of modern life, many people today face increased levels of depression, which can affect their physical and mental health. To address this, there is an increasing demand for products and programs that help individuals manage and track their physical and mental fitness. Recent statistics highlight the importance of mental health, with findings showing that 1 in 5 people in the country need mental health and psychosocial support, and that 45% of corporate workers have some form of mental health problem, which could get worse without them not focused enough.
